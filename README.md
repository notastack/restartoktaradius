# restartoktaradius

Due to a bug, sometimes the Okta radius stop responding and the WiFi becomes unusable.
Launch this script with the Task Scheduler, during working hours, to automatically restart the radius if it stop responding for at least 5 minutes.
Will sound add a bash version for the linux radius.
